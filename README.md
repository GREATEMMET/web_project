# WEB PROJECT
This is a holiday project from New Horizon Bootcamp..

## Intro

This is a website containing differnt webpages which are linked by href.

The website contains pages : Home and About, Product, Contact, Services, Login and SignUp which are all controlled for the navbar.

For this website, I will be using HTML | CSS | a bit of VANILLA JAVASCRIPT (trying to keep it simple so i am not way ahead of my colleagues )

For this project, I have decided to use a cargo and freight Company: NOORDX, a logistic company based in Nigeria.

I hope the project is fun
